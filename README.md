# Image Concerns in Pledges to Give Blood: Evidence from a Field Experiment

with [Egon Tripodi](http://www.egontripodi.com)

*We use a field experiment to study how social image concerns affect pledges to engage in a charitable activity. We work with two different blood banks and a municipal government in Germany to offer sign-ups for human whole blood donations. Motivated by a simple signaling framework, we randomly vary the type of organization to donate to and the visibility of the pledge. Our setting also provides natural variation in the group of people that form the ``audience'' for social image concerns. We find evidence for strong social image concerns when subjects are asked in public whether they would like to pledge a donation with a well-known charity. Pledges of our subjects do not to induce any charitable giving. Almost all subjects renege on their pledge, with no detectable differences between treatments.*
